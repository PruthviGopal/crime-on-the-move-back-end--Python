Crime on the Move Backend Server

This is a RESTful web service back end written using the Flask microframework in Python
to communicate with a PostgreSQL database.

This back end supports the Crime on the Move Android app: https://github.com/egaebel/crime-on-the-move--android-app

It provides the application with an endpoint to grab data on geospatial crime data and request processing on said crime data. The crime data spans counties in Northern Virginia and Washington D.C.
